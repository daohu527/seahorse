## design
You might be surprised that this autonomous driving system was developed in python. I know the speed is slow and can't guarantee real time, but its benefits are also obvious. It's easy to add features, verify algorithms, structure data, visualize and so on.

So this is probably the best project for **teaching and research** in the field of autonomous driving. Although this is a bit of an overstatement, we still want it to be the matlab of autonomous driving.

We call it the `seahorse`, small and delicate. Enjoy it and action now!!!
