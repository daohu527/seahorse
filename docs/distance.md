## Module name
distance

## Features
multi-object tracking affinity

## Design
When calculating similarity, we need some indicators to measure the distance. For example, we use Euler distance to represent the distance between 2 points, but what about 2 colors? So we need to introduce different distance functions to calculate the distance between different indicators.
